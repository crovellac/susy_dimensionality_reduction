# SUSY Dimensionality Reduction

## Abstract

Machine  learning  algorithms  are  a  great  ally  in  the  search  for  newPhysics.   One  of  the  many  goals  of  Experimental  High  Energy  Physics(HEP) is to identify events that are evidence of Physics Beyond the Stan-dard  Model  (SM).  Machine  learning  algorithms  can  be  used  to  achievebetter distinction between signal and background events in data analysisfor  the  purposes  of  signal  classification.   Additionally,  machine  learningmay be used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset.  Roughly speak-ing, a dimensionality reduction algorithm can infer correlations betweenvariables and combine them into unified (reduced) variables, thereby de-creasing the number of variables necessary to represent our information.This is of particular interest to new physics because these “reduced di-mensions” may reveal information about underlying processes which arenot  given  to  us  explicitly  by  detector  signals.   In  this  project,  we  seekto  reduce  the  dimensionality  of  a  supersymmetry  (SUSY)  classificationdataset using machine learning to construct these reduced dimensions andto evaluate our information loss using a neural network classifier.
